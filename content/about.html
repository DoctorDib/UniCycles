<h4> ABOUT </h4>

<section>
  <p>UniCycles is a project by Computer Science students from the University of Portsmouth to make travelling around the city more covenient for university students by creating an application that enables students to hire a bicycle. The bicycles are made available for daily use from 9 different locations around the city, and through the use of the app, students can see how many bicycles are available at each location, the duration of the hire, and where they can return them. The bicycles can be booked for either immediate use or for a later date.</p>
