				UniCycles is a project by Computer Science students from the University of Portsmouth to make 
				travelling around the city more covenient for university students by creating an application that 
				enables students to hire a bicycle. 
			</p>
			<p> 
				The bicycles are made available for daily use from 9 different 
				locations around the city, and through the use of the app, students can see how many bicycles are 
				available at each location, the duration of the hire, and where they can return them. The bicycles 
				can be booked for either immediate use or for a later date.
